top.parent-teacher	For guardians and educators
parent-teacher.kv.content	What ʘmʘchim can promise in educational settings
parent-teacher.learning.top_title	Players will naturally develop their programming and logical thinking skills while playing with the ʘmʘchim.
parent-teacher.learning.top_content	The best way to encourage learning is to make it enjoyable. Playing fosters further interest in a topic, and provides a natural and fun way to learn and continue learning.
parent-teacher.learning.bottom_title	<br>The prototype<br>hacking method makes learning fun.
parent-teacher.learning.bottom_content	The Prototype Hacking Method is a unique learning method born from a professional development worksite. Tapping into children's innate desires to experiment, kids will learn logical structures in a fun way through repeated trial and error, which fosters creativity. ʘmʘchim is a game that's designed with this method in mind.
parent-teacher.thought.title	A message from the developers
parent-teacher.thought.sub_title	"Creating your own way to play, through play." Creativity can flourish when there aren't any rules.
parent-teacher.thought.top	So, what exactly is a game? Most people will answer<br>that a game is any activity that "has rules."
parent-teacher.thought.middle	With this game, we wanted to eliminate rules as much as we could.<br>In doing so, we hope to have the players themselves think up<br>their own rules as part of what makes the game fun.
parent-teacher.thought.bottom	With ʘmʘchim, players are free to choose how they play.<br>Through the fun experience of "creating your own way to play,"<br>we hope that all players can experience<br>an enriching environment that fosters creativity.
